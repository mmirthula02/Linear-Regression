# Predicting sales revenue with scikit learn
To build both simple linear regression model and multiple linear regression model.

With a given advertising data set we need to predict the sales revenue based on advertising spent through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper.

# Libraries used:
1.Scikit learn for calculating linear regression model.

2.Pandas for data management.

3.Numpy for mathematical calculations.

4.Seaborn for plotting data.

# Tasks evolved to build a simple linear regression model:
1.Datas were loaded and libraries where imported.

2.The data's were cleaned and pre-processed for further analysis removing unwanted columns.

3.Vizualised the data for model building using plots and looked at the disrtibutions of the predictors - TV ,Radio and newspaper.

4.Vizualised the correlation between predictor and response and created a heat map for corresponding correlation matrix.

5.The best feature is selected after predicting the relationship between the sales revenue and the expenditure on the various advertisment channels.

6.Creating a simple linear regression model using scikit learn ,With one predictor as X and response as y , a train_test_split module was used for sliting the data sets into train and test sets.

7.Intercept and coeffecients of the best fit line is predicted.

8.Determing y_pred and Plotting the best fit line.

9.Evaluating performance of algorithm.
